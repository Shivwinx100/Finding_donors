    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "After trying all the models as all of them are Classification models, I have selected Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression as candidate models.\n",

    "1) Random Forest:\n",
    "Random forest model can be applied in medical domain to identify a disease based on symptoms. Example: detection of Alzheimer's disease.\n",
    "Strengths - very good for large datasets, gives estimates of feature's importance, can be run in parallel to speed up training, reduces variance caused by decision trees by combining multiple decision trees.\n",
    "Weaknesses - relatively high prediction time\n",
    "Candidacy - random forest gives good performance when there are categorical variables. As there are around 45000 entries, random forest can train much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "Gradient Boosting can be applied in ranking algorithms, like ranking of searches by search engines. Example: McRank: Learning to Rank Using Multiple Classification and Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "Strengths - very good for large datasets, reduces bias and variance, combines multiple weak predictors to a build strong predictor.\n",
    "Weaknesses - relatively high training time, over-fitting if the data sample is too small.\n",
    "Candidacy - the data we have is sufficiently large and clean so gradient boosting is suitable in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Logistic Regression:\n",
    "Logistic Regression is very widely used in the case of binary classification problems, very common example being whether a user will buy a product or not.\n",
    "Strengths - fast in training and prediction time, gives good results in case of less features\n",
    "Weaknesses - assumes linear decision boundary, cannot decode complex relationships between features.\n",
    "Candidacy - problem is of binary classification with clean data, all favourable conditions for logistic regression.\n"

With each round, the model finds the best learner (or decision tree) to incorporate into the ensemble, repeating the process for the specified number of rounds, or till we can’t improve the predictions further. All the learners are then combined to make a final ensembled model, where they each vote to predict if a person earns more than 50k or not. Usually we take the majority of the votes to make a final prediction. Using this model with the census information of individuals, we can predict the same information for a potential new donor and predict if they earn more than 50K or not, and thus make a decision on the likeliness of them donating to charity.\n"

It must be remembered, that this predictor is naive in that it always assumed an individual made more than $50,000. In such a scenario, there will be no true negatives or false negatives. This results in accuracy being the same as precision. It is encouraging to see that the optimised model is performing that much better than the benchmark, as it means the model and its parameters were the correct choice, and no errors with the data were made.\n"

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "capital-gain - What is their current monetary capital gains (indication of current wealth, and potential yearly earnings). I have ranked this above capital loss purely as there was far more populated data samples for capital-gain, and therefore more useful for modelling.\n",
    "hours-per-week: This is, for those either employed by the state or privately, simple mathematics. For the most part, those who work 40-50 hours a week should be recieving more than those working say, 10 hours a week. However, occupation is an important factor in this, as you may be working 50 hours a week at McDonalds, or 10 hours a week as an investment banker. This is why I have rated occupation higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "education-num - Education level could be a predictor for the level of skilled or unskilled work someone could obtain. For example, someone with a college degree in computer science could work for a software company, earning a large salary whereas someone who has only obtained a high school degree may work in a less specialised and qualified role, earning less. However, there may also be cases where people are self educated, just like a software engineer, so it is not always a guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "occupation -  the actual occupation will also be useful to determine salary - for example, did you graduate college with an arts degree and go on to work in mid-level employment, or did you graduate as a doctor, who works as a head surgeon in a hospital?\n",
    "\n",
    "age -as I feel experience and an opportunity to climb the ladder of progression should show some correlation with a persons age. For example someone who is out of University 5 years, as oppose to someone who has been out of University 20 years should show a trend in real earnings comparitively.\n"

    "Of the five features listed above (age, hours-per-week, capital-gain, marital-status, relationship), three of these were the same as mine (age, hour-per-week, capital-gain).

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The accuracy drop using the reduced feature set is good, seeing around a 6% drop in accuracy when compared with the full 13 feature set. I would be happy to use this lowered accuracy score if training time was a factor, as 78% is still a great result for removing over half the features (5 Vs 13).\n",

    "However, the F-score sees a substantially greater drop, falling by just over 20%. This is not acceptable for me, as we want an f-score as close to possible as 1. Previously, with the full 13 features and optimisation, we were achieving close to 70% on our f-score. With the reduced training set, we are not even getting 50%. One option would be to consider other models to see if they would provide a better tuned score with the reduced set that I previously listed as too slow (SVM) on the full feature set. If SVC could provide an f-score close to the 68% figure, with reduced training time, then I would consider using the reduced training set.\n"
